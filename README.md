## Inspiration
Our project was inspired by our idea to turn health into something more fun and interactive.
## What it does
Our project has options for the user to pick what feature they want to use from our website/app. Our features so far are puzzle, prescription, Eye Timer, and Physical.
## How we built it
We built a website using Svelte, Tailwind, Typescript, Rust, Tauri, and other libaries. Then we ported it to support other devices.
